Assistant CRM Reply Service Module
==================================

This module handles the core logic for generating intelligent chatbot responses.
It uses keyword-based NLU (Natural Language Understanding) with expansion points
for integrating advanced AI services like Gemini, OpenAI, or custom models.

Author: Construction Development Team
Created: 2025
License: MIT

Architecture:
------------
1. Message preprocessing and validation
2. Intent detection using keyword matching
3. Context-aware response generation
4. Conversation logging and analytics
5. Extensible AI service integration points

Future Enhancements:
------------------
- Gemini AI integration for advanced NLU
- OpenAI GPT integration for conversational AI
- Custom ML models for domain-specific understanding
- Multi-language support with translation
- Sentiment analysis and escalation triggers

        6. Maintain conversational flow and stress-free experience

    Quality Standards:
        - Directly answer the user's question rather than providing tangential information
        - Create a stress-free, supportive experience
        - Ensure responses are immediately actionable
        - Maintain professional competence while being genuinely helpful

    Test Cases:
        - get_bot_reply("Hello") -> Empathetic greeting with service offer
        - get_bot_reply("I'm frustrated with my claim") -> Acknowledges frustration, provides action steps
        - get_bot_reply("") -> Error handling with supportive tone
        - get_bot_reply("Random text") -> Clarifying questions with understanding tone
